I am an incoming phd student of University of Science and Technology of China(USTC) advised by [Qing Li](https://liqing.io/) and [Jie Wang](https://miralab.ai/people/jie-wang/). I will receive my bachelor's degree from Harbin Institute of Technology(HIT) in 2025. 

Currently, I am focusing on research in LLM Agents, multimodality, and reinforcement learning. If you are interested in collaborating with me, please email me at miyapeng78@gmail.com.
